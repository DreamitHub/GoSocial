If you're experiencing a problem that isn't covered in our Known Issues, please follow these troubleshooting steps. Keep in mind that you should always make sure you're running the latest version of the Mantra app as well as the latest version of your phone or tablet's operating system before following these steps.

Restart your phone or tablet

Always try restarting your phone or tablet first if you're having trouble with Mantra.

Check Internet connection

If restarting your device doesn't help, please try using Mantra both on Wi-Fi and on your mobile data connection to see if the problem is because of a weak Wi-Fi or mobile data connection.

Uninstall and reinstall

If restarting your device and checking your connection doesn't help, try deleting and reinstalling Mantra:

iPhone and iPad

From the Home screen, tap and hold the Mantra app icon until it shakes.
Tap x on the app to delete it. Your photos and profile info will be saved by Mantra.
Go to the App Store, reinstall Mantra and then log in with your username and password.
Android

Go to your phone or tablet's Settings and tap Applications > Manage Applications > Mantra.
Tap Uninstall.
Go to the Google Play Store, reinstall Mantra and then log in with your username and password.

Still no luck?
